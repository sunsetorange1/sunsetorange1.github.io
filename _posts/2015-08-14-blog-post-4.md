As an active member of the **competitive Team Fortress 2 (TF2)** community, I’ve always been passionate about improving the experience for other players. One major issue I identified was that nearly all community servers in Australia were hosted in **Sydney**, which created higher latency for players in **Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth**. To address this, I decided to configure and host my own dedicated TF2 server in **Melbourne**.

This project involved:
- Installing and configuring **SourceMod** and **VScript** for competitive play
- Setting up **custom server configurations** to align with competitive rulesets
- Implementing **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** using Steam IDs
- Adding **custom plugins**, **anti-cheat tools**, and **server advertisements**

The setup required a deep understanding of the Source engine and Linux-based server hosting. There were definitely challenges—especially with plugin compatibility and maintaining server stability under high player load, but working through them was a rewarding experience that sharpened both my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

The server continues to run to this day, offering a much-needed low-latency alternative for players across southern and western Australia. 
Being able to contribute something meaningful back to a community that means a lot to me has made this one of my favourite personal projects.
