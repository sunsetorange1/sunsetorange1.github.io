This was a small but satisfying project I took on one weekend after realizing I had a **spare Raspberry Pi** gathering dust. 
I wanted to do something useful with it, so I decided to turn it into a **private cloud storage server** using **NextCloudPi**.

The setup process was straightforward, installing NextCloudPi, configuring basic access settings, and integrating it into my home network. 
Within an afternoon, I had a fully functional private cloud that now handles personal file syncing, backups, and even calendar and contact management.

There were no major challenges, just a fun and low-effort way to make a meaningful improvement to my local infrastructure. 
Itâ€™s a great reminder that even small bits of unused hardware can be repurposed into something impactful.
