I've recently had the opportunity to work on several website development projects using platforms such as **Shopify** and **WordPress**. Here are a few notable examples:

### 1. [Haru Japan](https://harujapan.com.au) *(Shopify)*
**Role:** Web Designer & Front-end Developer  
**Description:**  
Haru Japan is a skincare and beauty online store developed on **Shopify**. I collaborated closely with the client to deliver a clean, elegant design that perfectly aligns with their brand identity and appeals directly to their target audience.

### 2. [Oh Honey](https://ohhoney.au) *(Shopify)*
**Role:** Front-end Developer & Technical Integration  
**Description:**  
Oh Honey presented unique technical challenges, requiring advanced integrations such as a **store locator** and **Google Maps** functionality. I successfully incorporated these features into the Shopify site, meeting the client's specific business requirements.

### 3. Noob Pugs *(WordPress)*
**Role:** Front-end Developer & Hosting Administrator  
**Description:**  
Noob Pugs is a community-driven website built with **WordPress**, aimed at promoting a Competitive **Team Fortress 2** Discord server. I managed the hosting, site setup, and front-end development, aligning the site closely with my personal passion and expertise in gaming communities.
